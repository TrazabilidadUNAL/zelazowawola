# Agri-Food Traceability Project (Gretel) Frontend

This is the Agri-Food Traceability Project Frontend for Software Engineering II course.

## Developers instructions

Do as indicated to start with the project from scratch:

* Clone the repo via `git@github.com:TrazabilidadUNAL/zelazowawola.git`
* Go into the folder and initialize the git flow via `git flow init` keeping in mind that all the defaults should be allowed, except the version tag which is empty by default. For the version tag use a lowercase v: `v`

Remeber to be carefull with the work you do and in doubt, please report any question to your Scrum Master: [Angel Rendon](mailto:amrendonsa@unal.edu.co).

Both, `master` and `develop` branches are being set as protected to avoid writing in them. Every branch intended to be merged with `develop` has to have its respective [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help
